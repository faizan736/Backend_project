 /*

 a. destination Function:

Determines the folder where files will be saved.
In this case, files will be stored in the ./public/temp folder.
cb is a callback function that tells Multer where to save the file. The null means no error occurred.
b. filename Function:

Determines the name of the saved file.
file.originalname ensures the file keeps its original name
 */

/*
Your code is used for handling file uploads, so when a user uploads a picture (or any file) from their device (e.g., via a form), Multer:

âœ… Receives the file (e.g., an image from a form)
âœ… Saves it in the ./public/temp folder
âœ… Keeps the original file name

So, if a user uploads a file called profile.jpg, it will be stored as:
ðŸ“‚ ./public/temp/profile.jpg
